        Mars remains the primary target for near-future exploration. With missions like NASA’s Artemis program aiming to
        establish a sustainable presence on the Moon, Mars is seen as the next logical step. Plans are underway to send the
        first crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, which will involve testing life-support systems, creating habitats using
        Martian soil, and generating oxygen from the planet’s atmosphere. These initiatives are not only scientific in nature
        but also serve as practice for longer, more distant missions.
